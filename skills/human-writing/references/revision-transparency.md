# Revision Transparency

A rewrite can improve prose while making the publication record less trustworthy. Treat an already-published artifact differently from an unpublished draft.

## Classify the Change

- **Copyedit:** grammar, punctuation, formatting, or wording changes that do not alter meaning.
- **Clarification:** makes an existing claim easier to understand without changing its factual content, scope, recommendation, or risk.
- **Material correction:** fixes a wrong or misleading fact, command, configuration, metric, conclusion, recommendation, scope, or risk boundary.
- **Substantial update:** adds a new version, method, result, limitation, or conclusion that changes how a reader should use or interpret the article.

Copyedits usually do not need an update note. Material corrections and substantial updates do.

## Required Handling

For already-published material:

1. preserve the original publication date when the format supports a separate update history
2. add a dated update or correction note near the opening for a material correction or substantial update
3. state what changed precisely enough for a returning reader to understand the difference
4. preserve the corrected command, claim, scope, source, and risk boundary in the body
5. follow the target platform's current official placement and wording rules

Do not silently replace a material error, reset the original publication date to make the article look newly published, or describe a correction as a cosmetic edit. Do not add a correction note when only spelling, punctuation, or layout changed.

A useful note is concise:

```text
更新（2026-07-11）：修正 `includeIf` 条件关键字为 `hasconfig:remote.*.url`，并补充 HTTPS/SSH 匹配、配置来源检查和适用边界。
```

## Platform Verification Boundary

Treat placement, wording, labels, and disclosure thresholds as current external claims. Before calling an artifact platform-ready, verify the target platform's current official rule and record the authoritative source and check date when compliance matters. If the rule cannot be verified, preserve a truthful dated correction note without claiming platform compliance.

## Regression Check

Input:

```text
- the article was already published
- the previous configuration used an invalid condition keyword
- the corrected article now uses `hasconfig:remote.*.url`
- the original publication date is known
```

Must:

- preserve the original publication date
- add a dated correction note near the opening
- name the corrected condition keyword
- keep the corrected configuration and verification steps in the body

Reject if the rewrite silently replaces the invalid configuration, changes the original publication date to the correction date, or says only `updated for clarity`.
